# Quickstart

1. [Get Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)!
    - The unofficial official Mac package manager


2. [Get Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary/)!
    - The fastest terminal
    - Supports full-color which is needed for Neovim theme

3. Get Neovim!

        brew install neovim

4. Install other goodies!

        brew install atuin zellij

   - **Atuin is a visual Reverse-R search**
   - Zellij is TMUX written in Rust
   - Zellij breaks some Kitty features (like clicking links) so I use Kitty tabs more often
